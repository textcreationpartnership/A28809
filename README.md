1. Excellent Encouragement for Setling an English Plantation at MADAGASCAR in ASIA.

    _ CHAP. I. The occasion of printing this rude treatise or pamphlet, Prince Ruperts intent to plant at Madagascar, Master Walter Hamonds book in praise of this Island will give good incouragement for a plantation, he that is Lord or King of Madagascar may easily in good time be Emperour of all India, also the cheapnesse of necessaries both for back and belly to be had out of India for the present reliefe of the planters.

    _ CHAP. II. The Countries scituation under the Tropick of Capricorne the healthfulnesse of the Country, Augustines bay a chiefe and excellent harbour for multitude of ships, the pleasantnesse and fertility of the Country, a second land of Canaan or a Paradice of the world, the Portugals rich trade to Mussambeg on the coast of Malindia.

    _ CHAP. III. Hogs in Malinda have stones in their mawes as pretious as rich Iewels, the affection of the inhabitants to our Nation above all others, Portugall Fryers slaine to accompany the King of Madagascar at his death to heaven, great store of wildo Foule and Turkies, the Envy of the East India Company against a plantation may give the better incouragement thereunto: no Gold Silver nor any rich commodity of so high esteeme in Madagascar as red Cornelian Beads.

    _ CHAP. IIII. The comlinesse of the Natives though naked, yet personable and of pleasant countenance, their weapons not dangerous or of great annoyance, their small use and unskilfullnesse in labour or manufacture, great probability of sugar and spices at Madagascar, the praise of the Island comparable with the land of Canaan.

    _ CHAP. V. The Idolatrous worship of God, or the Devill, the Natives addicted to theft and robbery. A project of the Bishops deposed to plant at Madagascar, Madagascar sauegard rasbly attained unto.

    _ CHAP. VI. Great incouragement to the plantation, the cheapenesse of cloathing or apparrell to be bad out of India for the use of the planters, the rich attire for persons of quality to be had there exceeding cheape, all sorts of hearbs roots fruits and foules to be bad in plentifull abundance in Madagascar, trees yeelding great store of pleasant liquor nothing inferiour to wine and sugar in England, the excellent vertue of India Mirabolins.

    _ CHAP. VII. The cheapenesse of all sorts of cattell and food at Madagascar, the Turkies before mentioned in Mr. Lloyds intelligence are not so large and good as ours, and I rather accompt the Sa•ts or such like fowle but being all over speckled blacke and white our people give them the name of Turkies, the great benefit to be made by dayries at Madagascar, with the meanes to accommodate the making of butter and cheese in that hot Country, as also for poudering of Beefe and brewing of good Beere.

    _ CHAP. VIII. The accommodation and meanes for dayries, brewing of beere and powdering of meat for the use of ships at sea, the meanes to make Saltpeter cheaper then in India or elsewhere, all sorts of excellent materialls for building to be had in Madagascar, poore artificers may live by their labours in all sorts of manufacture, out strip all Nations of the world for the price of their labour, trade and commerce to and from Madagascar will exceede in benefit all other.

    _ CHAP. IX. The Riches to be accrewd by Trade between England and India, may all be converted by a free Trade to the Planters at Madagascar, the benefit of particular commodities, to and from between India and Persia; the Piscash of a Chain of Gold given by Podomsee, though of 500. pound Valew not comparable to the benefit he received by fraight and custome in his Massie Treasure in Pearles, the Massie rich Trade of Pearles, and Diamonds from Persia into India, &c.

    _ CHAP. X. The mighty losse to the Portugalls in Customes, by the losse of Ormus, which might haue been turned to the benefit of the English, who Conquered it and indiscreetly deserted it to the benefit of the Persians.

    _ CHAP. XI. A brave Sea fight with the Portugals upon the coast of India, another brave Sea fight with one English ship against many Portugals in the gulfe of Persia, the Portugals cruelty to our men taken prisoners in coole blood.

    _ CHAP. XII. The Portugals mediation for peace with the English Nation, the Persians valuation of Ormus, at twenty Millions of treasure, now they are possessed thereof, which the English might have enjoyed, if they had had wise Governours, Committees, and Agents, of the India corporation; the exceeding folly of the East India court, in sending treasure into Persia, to touch at Surrat, where the money being invested in commodities would have turned almost to double money profit, the unconsionable custome of India Courts in not shipping out our own rich native commodities, which would yeeld good profit, but transporting much Gold and Silver, to their countries losse, and proofe of their ill office to the Common-wealth; the way to drive a rich trade into India, without transportation of treasure. Multitude of English commodities beneficiall for transportation into India, to save exportation of treasure, if the India courts were good members of the common-wealth; the beneficiall trade in India, between Surrat and Goa neare adjacent: all commodities from Surrat to Bantam vendible, at great beneficiall prizes.

    _ CHAP. XIII. The exceeding rich trade from Surrat to China, and also a rich trade from China to India, though this beneficiall trade be neglected by the English sluggish injudicious Court Committees; if a free trade were open, diligent industrous Merchants would leave no place unassayed where there is great hopes or certain assurance of large profit, the profitable trade from India to Moco in the Red Sea, the way to inrich our usurers with more security of conscience by letting Moneyes at interest to Heathens rather then to Christians and at double the Rates, for their greater incouragement. Industrious men in open trade will find out for more severall sorts of Commodities, then the India injudicious Courts (never exercised in the practick of that commerce) doe looke into, and no doubt but as beneficiall.

    _ CHAP. XIIII. A beneficiall trade to be made at the Port of Swollow road, where all Christian Ships and others resort at fitting times; incouragement to young Merchants or decayed persons of a good and honest repute at home in their owne Country, a meanes to draw on Adventures in purse and person to Madagascar.

    _ CHAP. XV. The valour of the English Nation against the Salvages in Virginia and new-England, also of the Spaniards against a civil nation in America, or the west Indies, also of the Spaniards and Portugals against the Brasilians, and against the Indians a mighty warlike nation, also the designe of other Nations, jeering us for not setling a plantation somewhere in India for our succour and defence, ought to stirre us up to such an enterprize, the honour and blessing of a pious christian nation, to settle true religion among Idolatrous heathen people, to Gods glory and honour; The barbarous cruell oppression of the Dutch against the English at Amboyna in east India, being to mighty and to strong for the English to resist.

    _ CHAP. XVI. Esquire Cuourteen his worthy enterprize to settle the beginning of a Plantation at Madagascar, the partiallity injustice and ingratitude of the India Courts against their true loyall Brothers Servants; and corrupt favour to their Iugling, debauched, undeserving, mere bireling Servants. A commodity of great value to be regarded and searched for out at Madagascar and of great advantage to the obtainers thereof; Prince Rupert in a great forwardnesse to a hopefull Plantation at Madagascar, the Earle of Arundels intention to supply Prince Ruperts fayling in the project for Madagascar.

    _ CHAP. XVII. The use of Ordnance, Guns and Printing long in use in China, before used in Christendome, good admonition to give the glory to God, in this action and all others.
